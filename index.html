    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
        Our mission is to guide children, youth, and adults towards discipline,
        confidence, self-respect, and physical strength through authentic karate training.
        We strongly believe that martial arts is not just about fighting techniques,
        but a way of life that builds character before combat.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
        Karate begins with respect and ends with character.
        At Nayak Budokan Karate Academy, we follow traditional karate values that
        emphasize discipline, humility, self-control, and continuous self-improvement.
        Every student is trained to grow not only physically, but mentally and morally.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Training Pillars</h2>

    <h3>Discipline</h3>
    <p>
        Discipline is the foundation of karate.
        Through structured training and consistent practice, students develop focus,
        respect, punctuality, and responsibility in both training and daily life.
    </p>

    <h3>Strength</h3>
    <p>
        Strength is not limited to physical power.
        Our training improves stamina, balance, flexibility, coordination,
        and mental resilience, helping students face challenges with confidence.
    </p>

    <h3>Self-Defense</h3>
    <p>
        Self-defense builds awareness and confidence.
        Students are taught practical techniques along with the importance of control,
        responsibility, and respect for others.
    </p>
