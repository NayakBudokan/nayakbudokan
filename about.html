<h1>About Nayak Budokan Karate Academy</h1>

<div class="section">

    <h2>About NBKA</h2>
    <p>
        Nayak Budokan Karate Academy (NBKA) was established with a clear vision
        to spread the true values of traditional karate, discipline, and self-defense.
        The academy was founded by <strong>P. Ganesh Nayak</strong> along with his dedicated team,
        under the guidance, blessings, and mentorship of
        <strong>Grand Master C. Hanumanth Rao</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        NBKA was not created merely as a training center, but as a place where
        students learn discipline, respect, confidence, and strong moral values.
        The academy follows traditional karate principles that focus on character
        development before physical combat.
    </p>

    <h2>Meaning Behind the Name “Nayak Budokan”</h2>
    <p>
        The name <em>Nayak Budokan Karate Academy</em> was graciously given by
        Grand Master C. Hanumanth Rao to his student, P. Ganesh Nayak,
        as a mark of recognition, trust, and respect.
        This reflects the sacred Guru–Shishya (teacher–student) relationship
        that lies at the heart of martial arts tradition.
    </p>

    <h2>Budokan Lineage and Legacy</h2>
    <p>
        Nayak Budokan Karate Academy proudly follows the Budokan Karate-Do system.
        Budokan Karate-Do International was founded in 1966 by
        <strong>Grand Master Chew Choo Soot</strong> in Malaysia.
        The system emphasizes discipline, strength, self-defense, and moral values.
    </p>

    <p>
        Budokan Karate-Do was introduced in India in 1978 by
        <strong>Grand Master C. Hanumanth Rao</strong>,
        who was personally trained and mentored by Grand Master Chew Choo Soot.
        His dedication laid a strong foundation for Budokan Karate across India.

    <h2>Karate – A Way of Life</h2>
